Yea.\nUse your arms for squeezing and pleasing the one that loves you so.\nOh there ain't no reason for you to declare war on the one who loves you so.\nSo forget the other boys because my love is real.\nCome off your battlefield.\nLay down your arms and surrender to me.\nYea lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yea.\nUse your arms for squeezing and pleasing that's the way it's gotta be.\nThe weapons you're using are hurting me bad.\nBut someday you're going to retreat.\nCause my love baby is the truest you've ever had.\nI'm a soldier of love that's hard to beat.\nLay down your arms and surrender to me.\nLay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yea.\nUse your arms to hold me tight. Baby I don't wanna fight no more. [x2]\nOh baby, lay down your arms. [x7]\nPlease baby lay down your arms.\n"
